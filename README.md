# osm-files
because mailing list has limited space for posting. I don't recommend reusing it, because i don't want you to make me conflicts in OSM when i upload the final version. Rather than talk on the specific file at imports[at]openstreetmap.org OR talk-us[at]openstreetmap.org OR the OSMUS Slack

The files are from Public Domain data.
But as I said, don't upload them to OSM because they're mostly work in progress, and the data is subject to change, like tagging and existing nodes, relations (or the data has been already uploaded!) Check https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ottwiz_import/history for more information.
