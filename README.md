# osm-files
because mailing list has limited space for posting. I don't recommend reusing it, because i don't want you to make any data errors in OSM. Rather than talk on the specific file at imports[at]openstreetmap.org OR talk-us[at]openstreetmap.org OR the OSMUS Slack

The files are from Public Domain data.
But as I said, don't upload them to OSM because they're mostly work in progress!!!! Eventually it will be uploaded by me, just with some modifications.
